We just published our local git repo 
to remote GitGub.com repository
Few Things happened:
1. It automaticall created new Remote Repo
under your GitHub.com
2. Made the connection with your local git repo
3. Added all your commits to remote repo

Now our work will continue locally 

1. add a new file called note.txt 
2. commited the change to local repo
3. we want this change to be reflected in remote repository so We PUSHED local commits to remote repository using push origin button 
4. Observe it has been added in your repository under GitHub.com
